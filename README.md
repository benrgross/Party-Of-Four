## Description
Keep track of your meals and their ingredients with Pipe Cleaner! This is an app for logging what you eat in order to analyze how it affects your gastrointestinal system.

Log your meals via `Enter Your Meals`.

If an ingredient in a meal seems to be having a negative effect on your digestive health, add it to your `Watchlist`.

Observe anything you may have eaten within the last few days with `Past Meals`.

Observe your `Watchlist` via the `Foods to Watchout for` tab.

You may also `Delete` a food time at any given time.
